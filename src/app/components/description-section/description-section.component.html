    <h4>State Managment using <span>@ngrx/component-store</span></h4>
    <p class="text-break">
      State Managment can be tricky, especially if each component has its own
      state. 
      <br>
      The below example contains three reactor-components each reactor
      changes its state randomly on an given interval.
      <br>
      Each State is managed via a Component Store which can be accecced via dependency injection.
      <br> 
      In this case the Reactor Manager Component is getting access to all States and displays the sum of all current States.
